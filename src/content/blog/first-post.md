Hello everyone! This is first time writing this post since I've been busy for months without blog. 
For now, I've testing around while I was working on improving some user interface (to make things easier to read and usable)

## The new blog
I planned it since my blog's design were... very strange, since it's a documentation and **is not designed to be a blog yet**. So I decide to make a new one by using Astro. I used the blog template, and it's easy to make modifications for my custom blog.

## What's next?
After I completed the blog, ensuring that the funciontality is working or not. I'd like to start writting new articles and story. I think that's it for today, have a nice day!
