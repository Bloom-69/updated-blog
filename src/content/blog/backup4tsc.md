Hello guys! I'd hope you are having a nice day (right?), at least if you asked me these following question: "How did you get banned here?". You may think the answer is *that simple*? Well, in reality it's **complicated,** as I said here. I'm going to show you how I got banned here, but first, I'd have to talk about TSC.

## Thunder Scientific Corporation is a toxic hellstew of ped\*phile and gr\*\*ming

Thunder Scientific Corporation is a Roblox place made by `FallingTower01` back in 2019 during its conflict between him and LT (Laboratory Tower), this place inspires most of Changed and SCP. But this place was ***horribly optimized***, which caused many crashes on any device (including my iPhone XR!) and the server dies due to severe memory leak.

In the community server side. Well, this is *no longer safe* for anyone joining in this server for the first time, since here's **a lot of stuff (and cases) happening** in any days. I was here since late 2021, I met some people (including my friend called Numeral, although it were nice, but sadly it got exposed ~~two~~ three time back in 2022-2023).

## `Backup4.zip` And OpenTSC Incident 
### When the leak happened
back in the start this year, one day when one guy (which I know) was harassed by mods until he would leave the community server. After many days, he returned and left us a small "gift" before he leaves the server completely, I decided to check it out what's inside this compressed folder. Sorta of...

In this compressed folder, **contained leaked stuff from TSC (including the leaked `.rblx` file)**. I took that folder, before I've switched back to Linux (I'd mean, Vanilla OS), I backed up this thing. And I left for months until July, I extracted it

### When the disaster struck
I know I did extract it my `Backup4.zip` and opened into the `.rblx` file, but I planned almost everything to make a open-source version of TSC named "OpenTSC", after those days, even through it was ready (eh, not so, since I already messed up with these variable on team without reason), I did release with a ""announcement"" (this is a message btw), and yeah, didn't know what happened next?

Wonder what?

It's happened in the half of **August** in this year, I've had to met the worst fate.

ISB just came in and threatened me that I'm going to be banned, and I did told him that's a old leak, and yeah I only obtained that one through from my `Backup4.zip`, then ISB **did not listen and tried to ban me by using Dyno**, Dyno started to don't function, instead, **it would get me banned via the f\*ucking discord's moderation system**. Without appeals.

## Aftermath
After this ban, I immediately closed and archived this project within **two day** after the ban. Also, I've left my backup compressed folder alone, floating around from my school account's 110TB shortage.

After some day, we did discuss this ban, one got the message from ISB about my ban, the claim was **right**, but *expect the line 5*...

> I **wasn't** active on getting these leaks. The only and **true** leak was from Ban. He bought it, don't blame me about that.

Well, I wasted about three-four days to make this article. Anyway, you guys have a nice day :)

**Remember to stay safe. If you find something uncomfortable (such as people doing weird thing to you), remember to report the message!**
