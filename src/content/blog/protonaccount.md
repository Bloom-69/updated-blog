Hello everyone, while I’ve been 2 months after the last post was released, so today I’ve done migrating 3 email into a single **Proton account and email**, for **piracy sake**. So yeah, this one did a successful move, but I probably buy a subscription to upgrade for a bit. But now here’s how I managed these 3 emails into one.

## Using EasySwitch: Auto-Forwarding and Importing an email address that doesn’t support Auto-Forwarding
I’ve created a new proton account, also **before** I started migrating as I said, I had to learn how to configure this thing. I had to set up the **auto-forwarding** feature so when an email is from Gmail, then it will automatically forward to my @proton.me address. This is easy, but next up, I want to find a verification mail when here’s an email (for example: you have an outlook.com address) doesn’t support auto-forwarding, but how do I find? 

Well, surprisingly, there’s an easy way to import your email provider. You connect an account you want to import, and also remember to check the permissions (and check these unchecked permissions) before importing a Gmail account, otherwise it will **not work**, once you connect, it will prompt you what types you want to import, there are three things you want to import (or don’t you want it):

- Email (remember: if a folder conflict with a different folder that was already here, uncheck it)
- Contacts
- Calendars

Once you finish fixing the conflict, you press done and Proton will import these things for you.

Also, once you finish, you can change the email address on your account on any different website, I’ve changed my email address on a specific website I use.


## Outro

This two feature Proton Mail made me an easy way to migrate and manage 3 email address simultaneously, while Proton doesn’t **actually spy on you or share any personal data**. Since **piracy is the default**.

Also, sorry for delaying the things up, I’ve been lazy for the time being. And yeah this site will get a big update very soon such as Material 3 and big layout changes.

Have a nice day!
